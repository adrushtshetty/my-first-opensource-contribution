# About Me

Hello, I'm Darshan, a passionate student with a strong affinity for coding and web development. 
With a love for turning ideas into functional and user-friendly websites, I've honed my skills in front-end and back-end development to create digital experiences that captivate and engage users.
I'm always on the lookout for innovative solutions and enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the tech world. When I'm not coding, you'll often find me exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, or sharing my knowledge with others in the tech community. 
I believe that the digital realm offers endless opportunities for creativity, and I'm excited to be a part of it.
