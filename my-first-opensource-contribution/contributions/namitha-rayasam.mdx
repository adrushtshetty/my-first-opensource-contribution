# About Me 
I am Namitha Rayasam, a third semester student. Since childhood I've always been keenly interested in: i) computer science engineering  ii)music. 
I am interested in AI/Ml, Robotics, Reinforcemnt Learning, Image Prcocessing, GenAi, Natural Language Processing

Add a description of yourself. 
I have wokred on projects involving robotics (SLAM) and Machine Learning.
I love exploring new concepts and technologies such as LLMs, Multimodal Systems, and Generative Models


# Projects:
● Iris Flower Classification using a Machine Learning Model using Python 
    ❖ BuiltaclassificationmodelusingKNeighborsClassifier
● Vacation Rate Prediction using a Machine Learning Model using Python
    ❖ ExploredalgorithmslikeRandomForestRegressor,LinearRegression,
    GradientBoostingRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor,
    MultiOutputRegressor GridSearchCV, etc.
● Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using 2D LiDAR
    ❖ Featuredetectionandtrackingsystemusing2DLiDARforSLAM.
    ❖ Tools:ROS,C++
    ❖ MyroleprimarilyfocusedonimplementingalgorithmsinC++,utilizing
    ROS2 to execute them effectively, and visualization using RViz.
    ❖ Thisincludedcoding,debugging,andoptimizingthealgorithmstoensure
    they performed as intended within the ROS2 framework.
